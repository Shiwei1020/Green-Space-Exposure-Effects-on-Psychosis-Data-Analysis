# Green-Space-Exposure-Effects-on-Psychosis-Data-Analysis
A series of statistical models to examine the relationships between green space exposure, behavioral measures, and clinical outcomes in psychosis

Specifically:
- OLS regression to estimate direct effects of green-space exposure (NDVI) on outcomes.

- Mediation analysis to test indirect pathways through behavioral and demographic variables, with bootstrapping for indirect effects.

- Moderation/interaction models to examine conditional effects across subgroups.

- Structural equation modeling (SEM) for path-based analyses of NDVI, mediators, and outcomes.

- Mean Difference t-tests for group comparisons and Simpsonâ€™s paradox plots to visualize aggregation artifacts.
